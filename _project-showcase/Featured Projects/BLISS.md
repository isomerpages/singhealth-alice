### Bladder Irrigation Sensor system (BLISS) Device for Enhanced Monitoring of Continuous Bladder Washout

BLISS is an automated device that measures the weight of the urinary bag collecting the outflow from CBWO. The device will trigger an auditory alarm when it detects low or no flow from the system indicating interruption from both inflow and outflow or blockage. This device facilitates closer monitoring of CBWO, promptly notifying nurses to perform early troubleshooting if required.
