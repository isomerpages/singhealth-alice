### Augmenting a virtual powered mobility aid (PMA) simulator for training new users to operate a motorized scooter/wheelchair in the community safely

Increasing number of people face mobility limitations that requires personal mobility aids (PMAs) to commute independently. 

Occupational Therapists conduct training and assessments to prescribe PMAs. The process is time consuming, patients require many sessions to master the skills.

We are exploring the use of virtual reality software for home-based competency training to reduce the time taken to master skills.
