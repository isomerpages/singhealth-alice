The development of NUS Boothless Hearing protocol allows clinically equivalent diagnostic hearing test without need of a sound booth. This is collaboratively developed in National University of Singapore and validated in audiology clinic of Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital. This protocol enables implementation of novel community clinics in the community settings. Some of the advantages include: increase access and mobility, reducing cost of infrastructure and allowing a quiet consultation room to be equipped with audiological set up.
