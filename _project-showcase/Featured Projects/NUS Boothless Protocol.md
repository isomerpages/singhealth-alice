### Use of Innovative technology (NUS Boothless Protocol) in enabling audiology access

The development of the NUS Boothless Hearing protocol allows clinically equivalent diagnostic hearing tests without the need for a sound booth. This is collaboratively developed at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore and validated in the audiology clinics at the Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital. This protocol enables implementation of novel community clinics in the community settings. Some of the advantages include: increased access and mobility, reduced costs of infrastructure and the implementation of an audiological set up in a quiet consultation room.
