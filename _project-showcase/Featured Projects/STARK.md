### Self-Triage and Registration Kiosk (STARK) for the Emergency Department

<img style="width:80%" src="/images/stark%20machine%20picture.png">

Patient registration and triaging in the Emergency Department is manpower intensive, mentally taxing and time consuming. We can automate this safely while preserving patient confidentiality.

The patientâ€™s BP, PR, temperature, and oxygen saturation are measured by self-administered medical grade devices. 

Some minor conditions (P3) can be self-triaged, and the severity assigned by a series of screening questions administered to the patient, and can then be automatically assigned to the minor emergencies queue:
*  Back and neckache 
*  Toothache 
*  Minor cuts and bruises 
*  URTI
*  Upper and Lower Limb Injuries
