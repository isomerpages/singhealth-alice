#### Improving triage in the Emergency Department ( i-TED) 

i-TED is a blended learning and assessment application co-developed by CGH and VSM to complement A&amp;E Nurses triage training. The nurse learner is presented with real-life triage scenarios and they can interactively practise triage with realistic patient responses. Using AI, i-TED can also analyse learner’s performance and competency through their responses and decisions in the scenario role-play. Feedback on learner’s triage performance is given directly and immediately after every scenario.
