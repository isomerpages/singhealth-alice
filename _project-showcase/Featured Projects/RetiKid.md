### A novel AI screening tool for detecting chronic kidney disease (RetiKid)

RetiKid is an AI tool that uses photos of the retina (back of the eye) taken non-invasively to detect chronic kidney disease. It also presents results in an hour, which hence can be offered as preliminary screening - those who tested positive by the AI tool can be referred for further tests - to bolster early detection strategies.
