#### Portable gait assessment robot

Increased recognition of the value of gait speed in rehabilitation and heavy demands on therapistsâ€™ time led us to develop a device that would make assessment efficient and accurate and manageable by an assistant.  The product is a robotic device with inbuilt sensors that detect gait speed, and other gait parameters as the patient walks past it.
