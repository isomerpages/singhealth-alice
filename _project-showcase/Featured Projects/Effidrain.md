### Effidrain- A precision drainage device for chest and abdominal drains

Effidrain is a drainage device that can be adapted to existing chest and abdominal drains, incorporating a software for users to program drainage rates. 

The device is able to provide users with clinical information on fluid pressures in the chest and abdominal for correlation with patientâ€™s symptoms and comfort. 

The project is currently progressing in pilot human trials.
