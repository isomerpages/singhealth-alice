#### Integrated Healthcare Communicator (i-COMM)

The i-COMM app is designed by CGH nurses to enable healthcare professionals to communicate with patients whose first language is not English, thus creating a seamless and coordinated patient care experience. The newly enhanced i-COMM app contains 500 commonly used bedside phrases in Hokkien, Cantonese, and Malay. It is currently available on iOS and Android platforms.
