This project uses cutting edge additive manufacturing technology such as 3D printing to produce electron plaques for electron beam therapy. It is cheaper to maintain and procure as compare to the current practice of using Styrofoam. Further ideas can be expanded with 3D printing such as printing an electron plaque that can provide a similar dosimetric impact as using Cerrobend. This will reduce the workflow further and reducing the cost needed for the process. Other than electron plaques, 3D printing can pave the way to more applications such as fabricating boluses, immobilize devices, phantoms for 3D dosimetry in patient-specific quality assurance, etc.
