### Virtual Reality Cognitive Training (VRCT) for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) â€“ A Pilot Feasibility Study

This study aims to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a 10-weekly multi-domain VRCT program on the cognitive function (i.e. attention, memory, and executive functioning) of older adults with MCI. Results showed that the program was considered acceptable, safe, with high levels of adherence among older participants. Statistically significant improvements were found in visual memory and inhibitory control.
