### Reshaping Myofunctional therapy: Development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software to enable automated therapy monitoring and feedback for Sleep Apnea patients  

<u>***Fight snoring/apnea with our AI app!***</u>

Our AI-enabled smartphone App can help patient perform myofunctional therapy at home with feedback from the AI system to tell them if they are performing exercise accurately.  This app can improve patient snoring and sleep, reduce hospital resource utilization and provides a wider reach and scalability of therapy, which fills a large gap in myofunctional therapy for patients at present in the follow up care.
