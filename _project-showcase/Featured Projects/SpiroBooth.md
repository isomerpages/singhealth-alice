Being an aerosol generating procedure, spirometry tests had to be substantially reduced or stopped globally during COVID-19 pandemic, due to infection risk. SpiroBooth - a novel, self-contained booth with built-in automated infection control measures helped KKHâ€™s lung function laboratory maintain operational capacity and efficiency during COVID-19 pandemic and beyond; resulting in improved quality of care, patient safety and staff experience.
