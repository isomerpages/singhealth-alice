### The world’s first artificial intelligence-powered (AI) ultrasound guided automated spinal landmark identification system, uSINE®

KK Women's and Children's Hospital has implemented the world's first artificial intelligence-powered (AI) ultrasound guided automated spinal landmark identification system, uSINE®, to help women achieve successful spinal anaesthesia at the first attempt during childbirth. uSINE® harnesses technology to improve the quality of anaesthesia and to reduce complications.

uSine® transforms delivery of anaesthesia for women in childbirth:
* Ultrasound imaging and AI identifies the right location and right angle of spinal needle insertion 
* Successful spinal anaesthesia at 1st attempt
* Enhanced safety and precision leads to better health outcomes 
* Clinical trials showed success rates of 1st attempt at 92% (healthy weight women) and 82% (obese women), compared to conventional method of 70% (healthy weight women) and 43% (obese women)
