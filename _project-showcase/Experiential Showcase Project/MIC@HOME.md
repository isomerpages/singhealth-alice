### Mobile Inpatient Care @ Home

MIC (Mobile Inpatient Care) @Home is a “virtual ward” service that allows suitable patients to recover at home instead of being hospitalised. The model augments hospital capacity and leverages remote clinical monitoring so that patients can be safely managed at home. MIC@Home was first piloted at SGH (i.e. SGH@Home) with promising results and has now been scaled to three other SingHealth hospitals, namely CGH, KKH and SKH.
