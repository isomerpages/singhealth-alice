Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness affecting more than 80 million patients globally. It can be broadly classified into Open angle glaucoma (POAG) and Angle closure glaucoma. Current treatments for POAG are limited in efficacy and safety. The MIST device is a minimally invasive surgical instrument. It provides a safe, efficacious, and easy-to-use treatment for POAG.  

Current treatments for POAG are limited in efficacy and safety. Pharmacological treatment has poor compliance and limited efficacy. Surgical treatment has high costs and safety risks, and long term results are mixed. Our solution, the MIST device is a novel ophthalmic Microinvasive Glaucoma Surgery instrument, developed to lower Intraocular Pressure (IOP) in glaucoma while addressing the concerns above. The device provides an efficacious and sustainable way for lowering IOP. It is easy-to-use in a rapid procedure. Moreover, the device is low cost and accessible.
