### Frailty Screening using SCREENii  

*(Space-saving, Cost-efficient, Responsive, Economizes time, Easy-to-use, uses Normative data, Innovative, Intelligent)*

Large-scale prefrailty screening using the walking speed and handgrip strength tests is challenged by logistical, physical, and personnel issues. SCREENii is invented to overcome these issues. It is an easy-to-operate device that (i) integrates the 2 tests into a single device, (ii) provides measurements with precision, and (ii) incorporates normative data collected from Singaporean older adults.
