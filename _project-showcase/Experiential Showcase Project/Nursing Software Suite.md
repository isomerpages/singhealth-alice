### Patient Bedside Tablet Solution (Nursing Software Suites)

Patients in the general ward can access their individual care information anytime via an application installed on the tablet by the bedside. Besides care information, patients can also use the bedside tablet to access to the educational materials related to their condition and other applications to promote rehabilitation. The tablet also allows the patients to communicate with their care team efficiently. In the upcoming months, the functionality for patient and family members to self-chart the food and drinks consumed will be enabled to further improve their experience of care and increase care efficiency of our nurses.

### Portable Bedside Activity Device

SGH Nursing co-developed a customised bedside activity device that promotes movement through play. The device consists of a sensor-mounted chair, customised game and gamescreen holder. The chair and mount is height adjustable and easy to manoeuvre. A fishing game requiring patient to perform sit-to-stand was developed by Senzehub. This motion detection game provides an intuitive, interactive and engaging gameplay.
