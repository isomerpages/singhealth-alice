### Patient Bedside Tablet Solution 

Patients in the general ward can access their individual care information anytime via an application installed on the tablet by the bedside. Besides care information, patients can also use the bedside tablet to access to the educational materials related to their condition and other applications to promote rehabilitation. The tablet also allows the patients to communicate with their care team efficiently. In the upcoming months, the functionality for patient and family members to self-chart the food and drinks consumed will be enabled to further improve their experience of care and increase care efficiency of our nurses.

The tablet houses solutions to: 
* allow patients and family members access to their care records (*MyCare* app)
* enable personalised education and self-help activities based on care needs (*MyEdu* app, *Food In &amp; Out* app)
* access to game based *rehabilitation* solutions

Upcoming solutions powered by the bedside tablet: 
* Inpatient teleconult (med counselling, patient and family updates)
* Symptom reporting
* Patient centred history taking 

For enhanced care effectiveness and efficiency, every inpatient ward nurse is equipped with a corporate mobile device to curate educational materials, receive urgent alerts, and access patient medical data on the go. 

By early next year, digital wound solution will be introduced via nurses' corporate mobile device to enhance accuracy in assessment and save time on complex wound documentation.
