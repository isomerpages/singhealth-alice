### Portable Bedside Activity Device

SGH Nursing co-developed a customised bedside activity device that promotes movement through play. The device consists of a sensor-mounted chair, customised game and gamescreen holder. The chair and mount is height adjustable and easy to manoeuvre. A fishing game requiring patient to perform sit-to-stand was developed by Senzehub. This motion detection game provides an intuitive, interactive and engaging gameplay.
