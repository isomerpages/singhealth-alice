### Wireless in-situ real-time bleeding detection


BWATCH™ is a lightweight device placed over a patient’s bandage for continuous monitoring of bleeding following invasive medical procedures. The device detects the unique optical property of blood haemoglobin and triggers an alarm with as little as 1mL blood loss from the wound. BWATCH™ has been validated in clinical trial involving 250 patients and is patented in Singapore and USA.
