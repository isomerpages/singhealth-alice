### Smart Remote Monitoring of Vital Signs

CGH collaborated with Respiree and A\*STAR to develop and deploy clinically validated wearable sensors for remote surveillance of vital signs to track changes in patients’ clinical status. AI is being built to predict patient’s deterioration and allow for early intervention. The technology could also monitor patients in observation wards and emergency department as well as post-discharge in patients’ homes so that care can continue in the community setting.

Currently, review of patient’s clinical status in General Ward includes intermittent surveillance of patient’s vital signs by the bedside. However, using Respiree, patient’s heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and temperature can be measured remotely and wirelessly, reducing nurses’ time by the bedside, to focus on other clinical duties while allowing patients to have uninterrupted rest. Predictive AI algorithms are being developed and validated to predict the likelihood of patient deteriorating to enable early warning for clinical investigations and intervention, enhancing patient care and safety. Respiree could also be used to monitor patients throughout the care continuum from emergency department to post-discharge in patients’ homes.
