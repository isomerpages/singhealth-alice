### Smart Remote Monitoring of Vital Signs

CGH collaborated with Respiree and A\*STAR to develop and deploy clinically validated wearable sensors for remote surveillance of vital signs to track changes in patients’ clinical status. AI is being built to predict patient’s deterioration and allow for early intervention. The technology could also monitor patients in observation wards and emergency department as well as post-discharge in patients’ homes so that care can continue in the community setting.
