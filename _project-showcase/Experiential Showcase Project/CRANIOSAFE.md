#### CRANIOSAFE (Skullcap)

CranioSafe fills the void for patients after cranial surgery by providing a protective, comfortable, and inconspicuous shell to defend the vulnerable postoperative skull from falls and minor trauma. Its design allows patients to reclaim their lives, giving them to confidence to socialize and return to normal activities again.
