### Patient Bedside Tablet Solution (Nursing Software Suites)

Patients in the general ward can access their individual care information anytime via an application installed on the tablet by the bedside. Besides care information, patients can also use the bedside tablet to access to the educational materials related to their condition and other applications to promote rehabilitation. The tablet also allows the patients to communicate with their care team efficiently. In the upcoming months, the functionality for patient and family members to self-chart the food and drinks consumed will be enabled to further improve their experience of care and increase care efficiency of our nurses.
