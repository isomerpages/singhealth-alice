### A Swift, Safe and Accurate Beverage Thickening Device for Dysphagia Patient Care

Patients who aspirate on liquid beverages due to swallowing impairment often need to consume beverages that are thickened accurately to a recommended thickness level. Our product, VisBuddy, aims to accurately prepare thickened beverages that are **SAFE** for the patient (clump-free, accurate auto-thickening), **SWIFT** (faster than hand-mixing) and **SURE** for the caregiver (measure and verify viscosity).
