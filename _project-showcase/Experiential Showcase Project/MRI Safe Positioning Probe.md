### MRI-safe pseudo ultrasound probe 

This project aims to develop an MRI-compatible pseudo ultrasound probe to improve the consistency of patient positioning during MRI scans to facilitate image fusion for contouring during radiotherapy treatment planning by reproducing patient position of the prostate placement during the CT scans. However, the existing TPUS probe and autoscan probe kit (ASPK) are not MRI-compatible due to use of metal components.

The MRI-safe pseudo ultrasound probe provides an improved consistency of patient positioning during MRI, addressing the clinical needs on reproducing the treatment positioning during MRI scan. The effectiveness of this gadget on the reproducibility of patient position during MRI improves clinical workflow for prostate cancer patients that can also be used for patient education to improve compliance during setup.
