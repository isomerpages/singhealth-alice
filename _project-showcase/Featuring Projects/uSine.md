**Project name**

The development and implementation of a novel ultrasound guided spinal landmark automated identification system uSINE®

**Synopsis**

uSINE® is the world’s first ultrasound-based guidance system that determines the needle insertion point using machine-learning algorithm and automated spinal landmark ultrasound imaging of the lumbar spine identifying the correct insertion point. This enables clinicians to conduct pre-procedural scan for precise needle insertion to avoid multiple puncture attempts and enhance patient care. This technology is recently implemented in clinical practice.
